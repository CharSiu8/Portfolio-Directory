## Data Science

Insurance Claims Prediction with Logistic Regression: github.com/CharSiu8/insurance-claims-prediction-logistic-regression
- A logistic regression project comparing manual implementation with sklearn industry-standard workflow to predict whether car insurance customers will make a claim.
- This project demonstrates two approaches to logistic regression modeling:
    - Simple Solution: Blindly loops through features using statsmodels' logit function, then manually calculates accuracy using confusion matrix values (TP, TN, FP, FN).
    - Analytical Workflow Solution: Industry-standard approach with proper pre-processing, visualization, correlation heatmapping to pre-screen features, and sklearn validation.
